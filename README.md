# Gallery
This is a CRUD backend API build for storing managing image collections of apartments. It takes images for both interiors and exteriors and stores them in an easy to access manner. Image url stored in the database is a value of a particular property of that document. All images can be accessed through an `assetId`. `assetId` represents the apartment whose images are stored in the gallery. 

This is still a work in progress.
